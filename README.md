# probit-NNGP-code
This repository provides the data and codes to implement the method presented Scalable Predictions for Spatial Probit Linear Mixed Models Using Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes

# Source code
Source code of the package is contained in BRISC_1.0.5.tar.gz

#Tutorial code
probit_nngp_code.R, probit_TLR_code.R and probit_TN_code.R is a guide to implement the probit-NNGP, TLR and TN algorithms discussed in the package. 
This guide closely follows the tutorial in https://github.com/danieledurante/PredProbitGP to implement the TN and TLR algorithms. 

#Data
The used data in the article is available in BerberisMeshoDataBt1.txt.
